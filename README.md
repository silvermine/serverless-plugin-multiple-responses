# WARNING: DEPRECATED PLUGIN

Serverless now supports custom [response headers][sls-response-headers] and [status
codes][sls-status-code]. As such, this plugin is deprecated and no longer maintained. For
more information on the API Gateway proxy integration, please see
https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/2174

## What is it?

**This plugin is now deprecated and no longer supported.** It was originally a plugin for
the early versions of the Serverless framework intended to address the issues outlined at
https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/2046 (and in my - jthomerson - comments
there).

**Since you can now use the API Gateway proxy integration and have full control over
response headers and status codes, you should no longer need this plugin. See
https://github.com/serverless/serverless/issues/2174 for more information.**

## How do I use it?

The basic principle is that instead of adding a `response` attribute to your
HTTP event config, you will add a `responses` attribute.

The responses attribute is a key/value pair where the key is the status code of
the response (e.g. 200, 404, etc). The value can be:

   * `false` - which means "remove the default response configured by SLS (or another plugin) for this response code"
   * an object with the following attributes:
      * `headers` - just the same as the SLS `headers` attribute
      * `templates` - similar to request templates, this is keyed by the response content type
      * `properties` - any other properties to directly add to the CloudFormation template for this API method
         * typically this is used to add `SelectionPattern` for the error responses

NOTE: leaving one response without a selection pattern attribute makes it the
default response.

Below we will show two examples: a standard example where 200 is what your
function returns for a successful completion, and another example where it
needs to return a 302 as its default (non-error) response. The 302 response
example would be used if your were building a bit.ly-like endpoint, for
example.

```yml
# I recommend using variables to define your responses since they tend
# to be the same across all of your API gateway functions, but you
# certainly don't have to.
custom:
   defaultRegion: us-east-1
   region: ${opt:region, self:custom.defaultRegion}
   stage: ${opt:stage, env:USER}

         application/json: ${file(templates/standard-request.tpl)}

      'Cache-Control': 'integration.response.body.headers.Cache-Control'
      'Pragma': "'no-cache'"
   standardResponseTemplate: "$input.path('$.body')"
   errorResponseHeaders:
      'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': "'*'"
      'Expires': "'Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT'"
      'Cache-Control': "'no-cache, max-age=0, must-revalidate'"
      'Pragma': "'no-cache'"
   errorResponseTemplate: "$input.path('$.errorMessage')"
   # Here we are defining what would be under "responses" in your HTTP event
   # if you were not using the custom variables.

## How do I contribute?

Easy! Pull requests are welcome! Just do the following:

   * Clone the code
   * Install the dependencies with `npm install`
   * Create a feature branch (e.g. `git checkout -b my_new_feature`)
   * Make your changes and commit them with a reasonable commit message
   * Make sure the code passes our standards with `grunt standards`
   * Make sure all unit tests pass with `npm test`

Our goal is 100% unit test coverage, with **good and effective** tests (it's
easy to hit 100% coverage with junk tests, so we differentiate). We **will not
accept pull requests for new features that do not include unit tests**. If you
are submitting a pull request to fix a bug, we may accept it without unit tests
(we will certainly write our own for that bug), but we *strongly encourage* you
to write a unit test exhibiting the bug, commit that, and then commit a fix in
a separate commit. This *greatly increases* the likelihood that we will accept
your pull request and the speed with which we can process it.
